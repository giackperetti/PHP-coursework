# PHP Coursework

This repo contains the code i wrote throughout my 5th year of highschool in my computer science classes.
We worked on `PHP` web apps interacting with `MySQL` databases.

The exercises go over most of the commonly used features of `PHP`, ranging from the basics to cookies and session handling.
