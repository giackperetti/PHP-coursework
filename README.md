# PHP Coursework

This repo contains the code i wrote throughout my 5th year of highschool in my computer science classes.
We used `XAMPP`(`MAMP` on MacOS) to simplify the process of running `PHP` code interacting with a `MySQL` database.

The exercises go over most of the commonly used features of `PHP`, ranging from the basics to cookies and session variables.
